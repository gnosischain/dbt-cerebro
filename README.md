# Cerebro dbt

This repository contains dbt models that are used for analyzing blockchain data on the Gnosis Chain. The dbt (data build tool) models in this repository help in transforming raw blockchain data into actionable insights.

## Overview

This dbt project is designed to facilitate the transformation and analysis of Gnosis Chain data. Our models focus on several key areas:

- **P2P Network**: Analysis of various decentralized finance protocols operating on the Gnosis Chain.
- **Consensus**: Detailed tracking and analysis of token transactions to understand the flow of assets.
- **Execution**: Insights into wallet behaviors, including identifying key players and tracking wallet growth over time.

## Project Structure

- `models/`: Contains SQL models that define transformations on raw data.
- `macros/`: Custom macros for use within SQL models.
- `seeds/`: Seed files that contain static data used as inputs for models.
